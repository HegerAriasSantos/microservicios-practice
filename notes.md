# Study notes

## Concepts

- **Load Balancer**: A load balancer is a device that distributes network or application traffic across a cluster of servers. Load balancers are used to increase capacity (concurrent users) and reliability of applications. They improve the overall performance of applications by decreasing the burden on servers associated with managing and maintaining application and network sessions, as well as by performing application-specific tasks.

- **API Gateway**: An API gateway is a server that acts as an API front-end, receiving API requests, enforcing throttling and security policies, passing requests to the back-end service, and then passing the response back to the requester. API gateways are common in microservices architectures to provide a single entry point for clients.

- **Microservices**: Microservices is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services, which implement business capabilities. The microservice architecture enables the continuous delivery/deployment of large, complex applications, allowing an organization to evolve its technology stack.

- **Nats**: NATS is a high-performance messaging system that acts as a distributed messaging queue for cloud native applications, IoT device messaging, and microservices architecture. NATS is written in the Go programming language and is available as open-source software.

- **Kafka**: Apache Kafka is an open-source stream-processing software platform developed by LinkedIn and donated to the Apache Software Foundation, written in Scala and Java. The project aims to provide a unified, high-throughput, low-latency platform for handling real-time data feeds.

- **Git Submodules**: Git submodules allow you to keep a Git repository as a subdirectory of another Git repository. This lets you clone another repository into your project and keep your commits separate.

- **Docker Compose**: Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application's services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.
